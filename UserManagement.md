Admin Functionalities
  - Admins have access to a user management dashboard where they can:
    
  - View all logged-in users, including their status (active/inactive).
  - Change user status (activate or deactivate accounts).
  - Delete users, ensuring they cannot log back in.
  - Promote basic users to admin roles.

System Implementation

  - Backend: Flask with SQLAlchemy for database management.
  - Frontend: HTML, using Flask templates.
  - Authentication: OAuth2.0 via Microsoft Graph API.
  - Users Table: Stores user information, roles, and active status.

Security Considerations

  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensures only admins can manage users.
  - OAuth2.0 Authentication via Microsoft for secure login.
  - Data Protection: Proper encryption and security measures for user data.
